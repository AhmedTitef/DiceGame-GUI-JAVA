# DiceGame GUI Java
You will build a dice game that is similar to Poker. You will find a folder called DiceImages.zip on Blackboard under Homework2. Use these images for your dice. There are two versions of the dice: 1 indicating the dice is "held" and one indicating that it is not "held". Do not change the names of the png files! Otherwise I will not be able to test your code on my system. You should also use CSS to give your application an interesting look and feel. Change background colors, fonts, and buttons. Make sure the design techniques used match the principles we've talked about in class. Included in the Homework2 folder are some sample pictures of what your display might look like. Make yours look different (and hopefully better!) than mine. 

Rules:

The player has three rolls per turn. 
After the first roll, if the user clicks a dice, it will remain "held" and not roll the next time the user rolls the dice. Its image should update accordingly. 
Once three rolls are up, determine what is the best "hand" the user has. Inform the user of what hand they have and how many points they received this round.
The "Roll" button should say "Play Again" once the player's turn is over. This should clear the Dice, allowing the user to start over.
Keep track of how many points overall the user has (i.e. keep a running total of how much they scored each turn)
Hands:

5 of a kind - 10 points
Straight (5 numbers in a row i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) - 8 points
Four of a Kind - 7 points
Full House (3 of one kind, 2 of another) - 6 points
3 of a kind - 5 points
2 pair (2 of one kind, 2 of another, and 1 other value) - 4 points
2 of a kind - 1 point
